Tool for the Open SmartWatch IDE to check wether the toolchain is up-to-date.

Download the compiled version of the tool here:

http://underverk.blushingboy.org/sswTest_v0001.zip

To use it, make sure you:

1) have the smartwatch v0010 or newer (working with earlier versions is not 100% tested)

2) unzip the file you downloaded into your sketchbook folder, it should look like: */<personal folder>/smartwatch/sswTest*

3) create a subfolder in your sketchbook called tools and move the **sswTest** folder into it: */<personal folder>/smartwatch/tools/sswTest*

4) reboot your Open SmartWatch IDE

5) under the Tools menu you will see a new tool called **Update Underchain**

6) click on it to check whether you have the latest version of the toolchain, if not, you will be prompted with a dialog window

7) if you choose **Yes** on the dialog window, it will download, unzip, and substitute your older version of the toolchain for the current master branch in this repository
