# Create tools for the Processing open source programming language and 
# environment (http://www.processing.org)
#
# Customize the build properties to make the ant-build-process work for your 
# environment. How? Please read the comments below.
#
# The default properties are set for OSX, for Windows-settings please refer to 
# comments made under (1) and (2).



# (1) 
# Where is your Processing sketchbook located? 
# If you are not sure, check the sketchbook location in your Processing 
# application preferences.
# ${user.home} points the compiler to your home directory.
# For windows the default path to your sketchbook would be
# ${user.home}/My Documents/Processing (make adjustments below).

sketchbook.location=${user.home}/sketchbooks/smartwatch



# (2) 
# Where are the jar files located that are required for compiling your tool such
# as e.g. core.jar?
# By default the local classpath location points to folder libs inside Eclipse's
# workspace (by default found in your home directory).
# For Windows the default path would be ${user.home}/workspace/libs (make 
# adjustments below).

classpath.local.location=${user.home}/Software/smartwatch-0010/lib


# For OSX users. 
# The following path will direct you into Processing's application source code 
# folder in case you put Processing inside your Applications folder. 
# Uncommenting the line below will overwrite the classpath.local.location from 
# above.

#classpath.local.location=/Applications/Processing.app/Contents/Resources/Java/lib/


# Add all jar files that are required for compiling your project to the local 
# and project classpath, use a comma as delimiter. These jar files must be 
# inside your classpath.local.location folder.
#
# For creating a tool, both pde.jar and core.jar are required. (pde.jar should 
# then be located inside folder classpath.local.location). 
# The best practice would be to place both, core.jar and pde.jar into your local
# classpath location.

classpath.local.include=core.jar,pde.jar


# Add processing's libraries folder to the classpath.
# If you don't need to include the libraries folder to your classpath, comment 
# out the following line.

classpath.libraries.location=${sketchbook.location}/libraries



# (3)
# Set the java version that should be used to compile your tool.

java.target.version=1.6


# Set the description of the Ant build.xml file.

ant.description=ProcessingTools Ant build file.



# (4)
# Project details.
# Give your tool a name.
# When creating a tool, the name of the main class which implements Tool must be
# the same as the value defined for project.name in your build.properties.

project.name=sswTest


# Use 'normal' or 'fast' as value for project.compile.
# 'fast' will only compile the project into your sketchbook.
# 'normal' will compile the distribution including the javadoc-reference and all
# web-files (the compile process here takes longer).

project.compile=normal

# All files compiled with project.compile=normal are stored 
# in the distribution folder.



# (5)
# The following items are properties that will be used to make changes to the 
# web document templates. Values of properties will be inserted into the 
# documents automatically.
# If you need more control, you can edit web/index.html and web/tool.properties 
# directly.

author.name=underverk
author.url=http://github.com/underverk


# Set the web page for your tool.
# This is NOT a direct link to where to download it.

tool.url=http://github.com/underverk/sswTest


# Set the category of your tool. This must be one (or many) of the following:
#   "3D"            "Animation"     "Compilations"      "Data"          
#   "Fabrication"   "Geometry"      "GUI"               "Hardware"      
#   "I/O"           "Language"      "Math"              "Simulation"    
#   "Sound"         "Utilities"     "Typography"        "Video & Vision"  
# If a value other than those listed is used, your tool will listed as "Other."

tool.category=Other


# A short sentence (or fragment) to summarize the tool's function. This will be 
# shown from inside the PDE when the tool is being installed. Avoid repeating 
# the name of your tool here. Also, avoid saying anything redundant like 
# mentioning that it's a tool. This should start with a capitalized letter, and 
# end with a period.

tool.sentence=Check and update the Toolchain straight from github.


# Additional information suitable for the Processing website. The value of
# 'sentence' always will be prepended, so you should start by writing the
# second sentence here. If your tool only works on certain operating systems,
# mention it here.

tool.paragraph= 


# Set the source code repository for your project.
# Recommendations for storing your source code online are Google Code or GitHub.

source.host=GitHub
source.url=http://github.com/underverk/sswTest
source.repository=http://github.com/underverk/sswTest/


# The current version of your tool. 
# This number must be parsable as an int. It increments once with each release. 
# This is used to compare different versions of the same tool, and check if an 
# update is available.

tool.version=1


# The version as the user will see it. 
# If blank, the tool.version attribute will be used here.

tool.prettyVersion=0.1.1

# Include javadoc references into your project's javadocs.
